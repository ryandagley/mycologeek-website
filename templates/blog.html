          <p> At the time of writing this blog post, I'm hardcoding this text into the HTML.  I wanted to get out of that pattern
            so with the articles, I decided to use a method of using a template and serving up the artitcles that are stored as 
            Markdown files.  So far it works well, but it doesn't solve as much as I had hoped. 
        </p>
        <p>Aside from building up the projects, I've been on a bit of a fast!  It should has brought me some clarity.</p>

        <p>At long last, I've done it!  I've finally build what I initially set out to build!  I've set up two temperature sensors, and through a serious of other devices 
          and code, I'm sending that data to the website!  You can check it out on the monitor page.  </p>
          <p>With this, my CICD pipeline, and my cloud infrastructure in place, I can now expand as I wish at my own pace.  Whether I want to learn a little 
            HTML or CSS, I can add something to the website.  If I feel like tinkering, I can wire up a new sensor!  This is the sandbox environment that I 
            had originally envisioned and I'm going to enjoy the heck out of it!</p>
          <p>In the entire process, I found the AWS portions of it to be the most challenging and frustrating at times.  Sometimes a matter of permissions 
            will send me looking through all of my configurations and code.  However, through that frustration I've learned how to troubleshoot the system and 
            also the importance of good logging!
          </p>
          <p>Speaking of future expansions, it's probably a good time for me to make the blog look better.</p>

        <p><b>Current Status: </b>Danced out</p>
                                 
        <p>It's wedding season so I find many of my weekends spoken for, but just before heading out yesterday, I had 
          a breakthrough!  I was able to successfully instal a 3.5 inch touchscreen onto my Raspberry Pi4.  The last time
          I really struggled with this following the manufacturer's provided instructions.  I've lost those and it was a 
          blessing in disguise.  Through some trial and error, I now have a working device that I will use as a device health
          monitor!
        </p>
        <p>With that out of the way, I moved forward with getting historical data onto the site.  It turns out the API doesn't really
          support this very well, so it made more sense for me to collect that data on my own every day.  I'm using a Lambda to S3 pipeline
          for now.  I had some difficulty doing all the proper routing in Flask and working with Secrets Manager, but we...  well let's just
          say that we have data on the screen at this moment.

      <p>It has been a while since this site had any function.  I had turned off my sensors a while back so the Monitor page sat empty.  Today, I've decided to add some minor 
        function to the monitor page by using the OpenWeatherAPI and at the very least displaying weather data!  While not a major accomplishment, temperature and humidity will 
        definitely play a factor in the project.  As I want to obfuscate my API token, I put it in Secrets Manager and had some challenge pulling that into the project.  But in 
        the process of doing so, I was able to add some logging functions so I consider that a big win!

      <p>There's are a few idioms about best intentions and they all seem to say that best intentions don't count for anything. I intended to build this site using GitHub actions and Elastic Beanstalk. That was almost a whole year ago! 
        I couldn't figure it out and spun my wheels for a while then eventually had to move onto other projects... until today. I finally figured out a few of the issues and can happily say that at least for today, Mycologeek is now deploying 
        with a CICD pipeline. I now feel unblocked from adding to this site. What started as a Covid project is now a personal project.

                Adding a bit more since Github seems to be caching old workflow info.

              <p>Hello Mycologeeks!  It certainly has been a while.  Admittedly, COVID-19 and the state of the world really brought on the blues.  I've had to do a lot of 
                growing and learning in that time.  The world has become a harsher place, but I've become more light-hearted and focused.
              </p>
              <p>So what's the plan for Mycologeek.com?  I'm going to get back to it really soon.  At first, it needs to be an artchitecture project as this site is not deployed how I want it to be.  It's seriously
                a Flask site that gets copy/pasted into an S3 bucket.  I'm writing this blog post in an HTML file.  I've since learned better ways to do this and will start moving toward more current technologies.
              </p>
              <p>With doubts that anyone reads this, I still have a lot of faith that this could be a fine site for the "mad scientist" at home.  Stay tuned!</p>

              <p>Merry Christmas to all you Mycologeeks out there!  This Christmas I scored myself some awesome mycological goodies and got some planning done for the machines.  I expect to get a lot done in 2021 so I hope you'll keep following along.</p>
              <p>This week, with a bit of free time, I installed a light fixture that's controlled by Alexa.  While it's simple, it's an important step to go completely hands free in the environment and it encourages me to think of what other voice controlled mechanisms I can put in place as we continue to build.  That said, I've also revisited how I want to automate my mushroom grows and came to the following design.  I figure, this is the simplest route that I know how to take to automate continuous mycelial growth and fruiting.  </p>
              <center>
                <img src="static/img/blog/2020/MycologeekDesign2.jpg">
              </center>
              <p>Earlier designs introduced too much stress to the mycelium including cutting the cake in half or squeezing the cake.  I would have also had metabolite liquids everywhere making subsequent grows easily contaminated.  While I had envisioned fun solutions, I had to go back to the drawing board many times to simplify the process using what I know of mycology, which is only a little, but enough.</p>
              <p>...But!  Enough of the tech stuff, let me show off my Christmas haul!</p>
              <p>My wife got me a new apron!  It says "Kinoko" which is "mushroom" in Japanese.</p>

              <p>CBD Mushroom Tea Blend.  My wife is all about endocannabinoid tone so she encourages me to get in a regular dose of CBD.  This has a 5mg water-soluble CBD dose per serving and I think she picked it up at our local spiritual shop.</p>
              <center>

              <p>An Alehorn to drink the tea out of!  This is made from an ungulate's horn.  I will think mindfully when I drink from it.</p>
              <p>This little sign to encourage me to keep at it!  Chances are that not everyone in your life understands your fascination with mushrooms or technology.  That's the story of my life.  Gifts like this remind me that while I'm in the minority, I still have people cheering me on!</p>

              <p>I challenged myself to come up with 30 fun ideas to work on for Mycologeek and wanted to share some that I thought were pretty good.  I'm gonna save the best for later though.</p>
              <li>Build a leak sensor (since my basement floods sometimes)</li>
              <li>Let's e-mail me a weekly status report.  On what?  Business things.</li>
              <li>Voice activated door opener probably using Alexa</li>
              <li>Show off my new Arduino Grove kit</li>
              <p>I really enjoy journaling and I believe that thought exercises like these are slowly, but surely bringing me success.  I've got some big dreams and I'm optimistic that people will follow along as they start to come true.</p>
              <p>Had my first WFH Secret Santa today.  It worked out fairly well, but a few packages were still on their way from the North Pole.  My manager ended up sending me some sausage and mustard, which is perfect with me being a meatatarian and all.  Merry X'mas, my boss!</p>

              <p>Shortly after my last update, the city I live in had a construction error that caused my basement and a few of my neighbor's basements to flood!  I couldn't believe it!  Needless to say, it had an impact on my progress.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think I'm finally back at it.  We're a little busy at work, but I signed up for an architecting on AWS class for the end of January and I'm getting excited!</p>

              <p>I'm celebrating a new age and with that, I think I'll tell people about this website too.  I can consider today Mycologeek's public launch!</p>
                <p>Where will we be next year at this time?  How many Amanitas, Morels, LBMs, Blushers, and Russulas might we encounter?  What inventions do I get to bring into existence?
                We'll know in a year.</p>
                <p>Today, Heather and I walked through the park.  It was quiet and peaceful when suddenly, it sounded as if a train was coming.
                    The sound grew, and grew, until over head we saw hundreds a geese flying in to touch down in the lake.
                    I've never seen anything like it.  You could feel the energy that these geese were running on.  It was indeed an appreciated gift from nature.</p>
                <p>I'll be ordering a burger from <a href="https://www.tacomaburgerco.com/"> Tacoma Burger Company </a>tonight!  If you want to get me a gift, support your

                <li>That same friend gifted me some Lion's Mane spores as well.  These healthy mushrooms are thought to be a treatment for Alzheimer's symptoms and neuropathy.</li>
                <li>Built a cool tool at work on AWS and plan to use those techs here!  I'd like to build a CICD pipeline.</li>
                <li>I foraged my first Chantrelles out in the woods!  I had to climb on my hands and knees, but they were delicious!</li>
                <li>I spotted my first Psilocybe Cyanescens!  Those are otherwise known as "Magic Mushrooms" or "Wavy Caps."  I left them for the next adventurer.</li>
                <li>I added some flooring to the mushroom lab, but need to fix it.</li>
                <li>I just saw Borat 2: The Subsequent Moviefilm.  It was hilarious!</li>
                <li>Replaced my hiking boots with some new Altras</li>

                <span class="date">May 29, 2020</span></h5>

              <p>Over the last couple of days, we've had many plumbers, engineers, and an inspector in our basement.  With that chaos and WFH, the days blend together more than ever before.</p>
              <p>While not necessarily a fun part of the project, Artemis Lab is located in my basement right next to where plumbers are jack-hammering to reline our sewer.</p>
              <p>While not needed to make progress in the lab, there was always a concern that our old deteriorating pipe would give up sometime in the next couple of years resulting in a flood that we've unfortunately dealt with in the past.</p>
              <p>Since this is a DIY site, here's some pointers:</p>
              <p>1. When you buy a home, have the inspector scope the sewer.  Don't skip this.  We did, and I shoveled human poop for a day and now feel suspicious in my basement.</p>
              <p>2. A repair like this is costly - we've been quoted between $13K and 18K for our repair.  Many service companies offer financing at rates near 10% and some offer a discount if paying in full.  As we've been saving for a while and called multiple plumbers, we are getting our repair at around $13k after a discount.</p>
              <p>As for how low we can go, I'm told that most sewer lines slope at .25" per foot toward the sewer.  We're about 85 feet out.</p>
              <p>So... with a little bit of code: elevation_change = .25 * 85 we learn that our sewer is 21.25 feet deep. That doesn't seem right.</p>

              <p>I am feeling like quite the Ry-entist today.  I've made great progress on this project this morning.</p>
              <p>That said, the plumber might not show up today which will cause some delay to our plans.
              However, we won't let that get in the way of our plans!  Muahahahahhaha!</p>
              <p>What are those plans?  Well, I need to find a way to get the data on the monitor page to update.  Right now, that's a manual update that I made from pulling the source from my browser!  I'd be embarrassed if I knew a better way, and I will soon.</p>
              <p>If you know of a better way, comment down below!  Oh wait, you can't yet.  I haven't built that feature...  If you want me to build that feature, comment down below.  Oh... shoot...</p>

              <p>Over some late night cold-brews and hit-or-miss Netflix stand-up comedies, I had the wild idea of sending my sensor data up to S3 and that brought a lot of new ideas to the surface.</p>  
              <p>Much of the site is manually built right now, I'm even blogging this in HTML for the timebeing.  We'll see how that evolves.</p>
              <p>So...  If you're following along at home, Mycologeek's Artemis Lab will leverage the incredble power of AWS' billions and billions(/Carl Sagan voice) of servers to help us grow some mushies and flowers!</p>
